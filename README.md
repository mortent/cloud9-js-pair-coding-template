# Vehicle

Write some code that let's us create a Car and a Motorcycle easily.
The attributes for the 2 vehicles are:

## Car

- 4 wheels
- 2 lamps
- registration plate

## MC

- 2 wheels
- 1 lamp
- registration plate

## driveUntilEmpty()

- We need some way of adding fuel to a vehicle
- We need to define the fuel consumption of a vehicle
- Finally, we want a function that drives until the vehicle runs out of fuel

When has run out of fuel, it should return some info:
- total distance travelled
- vehicle info (wheels, lamp, registration plate)
